### step1

		After performing this process your Raspberry Pi can be used as standalone
		Access Point. You won't need additional router for connecting with it. 
		You will loose ability of connecting the Pi to any router or hotspot
		- as a client.
		You will still have ability to connect it to the Internet sharing device, 
		like router or PC via ethernet cable. You will also be able to connect 
		with the timer via Wifi from PC or mobile phone etc. - if you had range. 
		If during this process you would want to check detailed instructions,
		you can enter 'net_ap' folder from this repo, on your mobile phone etc.
		This process will require few reboots. Do you want to continue?
####


### step2

				Step 2.

		Next step requires performing some actions in GUI.
		You may write those informations down or take a picture etc.
		You can also print file 'step_two.txt' from 'net_ap' folder.
		Remember to do it BEFORE rebooting.
		After performing step 2. and connecting to timer again, 
		come back to this menu and enter step 3.
			
		connect PC to WiFi network: 
		name: raspi-webgui
		password: ChangeMe

		enter IP address: 10.3.141.1 in browser
		Username: admin
		Password: secret  

		Click:
		Configure hotspot -> SSID (enter name you want, eg. "RH-TIMER") 

		Wireless Mode (change to 802.11n - 2.4GHz)

		save settings 

		Click:
		Configure hotspot -> security tab

		PSK (enter password that you want to have, eg. "timerpass")

		save settings

		DON'T CHANGE OTHER SETTINGS IN GUI!  

		Please read carefully whole instruction from above before rebooting.
####


### step3

				Step 3.
		After rebooting you can connect to the timer, via Wifi or ethernet.
		WiFi: 10.10.10.10:5000 (10.10.10.10:5000 if connecting from a browser)
		ethernet: 172.20.20.20 (172.20.20.20:5000 if connecting from a browser)
		You can enter Access Point extra menu after rebooing
		and check how you can connect to the internet.
####


### step3

				Step 4.
		Connect PC to WiFi network:
		name: RH-TIMER
		password: timerpass
		if you have any problems connecting wifi with new name - try "forgetting" 
		the (old) network in PC's WiFi settings and than try again

		Now you should be able to enter the network typing in the browser:
		10.10.10.10:5000 - using WiFi
		172.20.20.20:5000 - using ethernet
####


### step last - page 1

		Right now you have your Access Point configured. However,
		there is still an option to mantain internet connection.
		You will be able to connect the Pi via ethernet to the router 
		or PC - with internet sharing option enbled. It requires chages
		in configuration file. Those will be performed automatically,
		after entering 'netcfg' or 'apcfg' in command line.
		Remember to reboot the timer after every change. Instruction
		can be also found in 'apconf.txt' file in net_ap folder.
		Remember that regardless how you have your Raspberry configured
		in a given moment, you can always connect to it using WiFi.
		It can be helpful if you don't remember how your timer was configured
		when you left it or when some troubleshooting is required.
		Open second page, for detailed explanation.
####


### step last - page 2

		When Raspberry configuration has been changed so it performs
		as Access Point or as a DHCP client (normal mode),
		configuration file is being copied with a proper name.
		Next you have to reboot, so changes can be applied.
		When you setup Pi as a client, you can just connect
		it to the router. If you are using PC as a internet sharing
		device, you have to enable that option in OS settings.
		Instructions for Windows can be found in net_ap folder.\n
		
		If you want to connect to Raspberry via SSH or VNC,
		when it's in client mode you have to know its IP address.
		Check it in router settings page or using special program 
		'Advanced IP Scanner' on a PC. If you are using Pi as a AP, 
		its IP is always 172.20.20.20 (ethernet). Remember to disable
		internet sharing functionality on your PC's OS, when Raspberry
		is in Access Point mode. \n
		Remember that you can always connect to the timer (eg. from yet 
		another device) via WiFi. It's wireless IP is 10.10.10.10.\n
		You can also read/print those instructions. File 'detailed.txt',\
		in net_ap folder.
