### step1

        After performing this process your Raspberry Pi can be used as standalone
        Access Point. You won't need additional router for connecting with it.
        You will loose ability of connecting the Pi to any router or hotspot
        - as a client.
        You will still have ability to connect it to the Internet sharing device,
        like router or PC via ethernet cable. You will also be able to connect
        with the timer via Wifi from PC or mobile phone etc. - if you had range.
        If during this process you would want to check detailed instructions,
        you can enter 'net_ap' folder from this repo, on your mobile phone etc.
        This process will require few reboots. Do you want to continue?

### step2

                Step 2.

        Next step requires performing some actions in GUI.
        You may write those information down or take a picture etc.
        You can also print or check on GitHub the file named
        'net_steps.txt' from 'net_ap' folder.
        Remember to do it BEFORE rebooting.
        After performing step 2. and connecting to timer again,
        come back to this menu and enter step 3.

        connect PC to WiFi network:
        name: raspi-webgui
        password: ChangeMe

        enter IP address: 10.3.141.1 in browser
        (or: 10.3.141.1:8080)
        Username: admin
        Password: secret

        Click:
        "Hotspot" (left menu) -> SSID (enter name you want, eg. "RH-TIMER")

        Wireless Mode (change to 802.11n - 2.4GHz)

        save settings

        Click:
        "Security" tab

        PSK (enter password that you want to have, eg. "timerpass")

        save settings

        DON'T CHANGE ANY OTHER SETTINGS IN GUI!


        Click:
        "System" (left menu) and "Reboot"

        reboot and connect to newly-created WiFi network using new password


        -- Read carefully whole instruction from above before rebooting --
####


### step3

                Step 3.
        After rebooting you can connect to the timer, via Wifi or ethernet.
        WiFi: 10.10.10.10 (or: 10.10.10.10:5000)
        ethernet: 172.20.20.20 (or: 172.20.20.20:5000)
        You can enter Access Point extra menu after rebooting
        and check how you can connect to the internet.
####


### step3

                Step 4.
        Connect PC to WiFi network:
        name: RH-TIMER
        password: timerpass
        if you have any problems connecting wifi with new name - try "forgetting"
        the (old) network in PC's WiFi settings and than try again

        Now you should be able to enter the network typing in the browser:
        10.10.10.10 (or: 10.10.10.10:5000) - using WiFi
        172.20.20.20 (or: 172.20.20.20:5000) - using ethernet

### step last - page 1

        Right now you have your Access Point configured. However,
        there is still an option to maintain internet connection.
        You will be able to connect the Pi via ethernet to the router
        or PC - with internet sharing option enbled. It requires chages
        in configuration file. Those will be performed automatically,
        after entering 'netcfg' or 'apcfg' in command line.
        Remember to reboot the timer after every change. Instruction
        can be also found in 'apconf.txt' file in net_ap folder.
        Remember that regardless how you have your Raspberry configured
        in a given moment, you can always connect to it using WiFi.
        It can be helpful if you don't remember how your timer was configured
        when you left it or when some troubleshooting is required.
        Open second page, for detailed explanation.

### step last - page 2

        When Raspberry configuration has been changed so it performs
        as Access Point or as a DHCP client (normal mode),
        configuration file is being copied with a proper name.
        Next you have to reboot, so changes can be applied.
        When you setup Pi as a client, you can just connect
        it to the router. If you are using PC as a internet sharing
        device, you have to enable that option in OS settings.
        Instructions for Windows can be found in net_ap folder.\n

        If you want to connect to Raspberry via SSH or VNC,
        when it's in client mode you have to know its IP address.
        Check it in router settings page or using special program
        'Advanced IP Scanner' on a PC. If you are using Pi as a AP,
        its IP is always 172.20.20.20 (ethernet). Remember to disable
        internet sharing functionality on your PC's OS, when Raspberry
        is in Access Point mode. \n
        Remember that you can always connect to the timer (eg. from yet
        another device) via WiFi. It's wireless IP is 10.10.10.10.\n
        You can also read/print those instructions. File 'detailed.txt',\
        in net_ap folder.
