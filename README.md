# Please go to the new repo: https://github.com/RotorHazard/RH_Install-Manager


# Easy mange and update your [RotorHazard](https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard) installation.



### Main features of the software:

1. Wizard install/update of RotorHazard server software:
    - Choose which version of RotorHazard to install
    - Preserves existing RotorHazard config file
    - Backup of existing RH install
    - Automatically performs much of the RotorHazard specific Pi setup steps
    - Automatically detects used Pi model and performs system setup accordingly

1. Wizard install and update of RotorHazard nodes firmware.
    - Works with official
      RotorHazard [PCB](https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard/blob/main/resources/PCB/README.md) out of the box
    - Possible to use with older PCBs or with custom-builds - described [here](how_to/hw_mod_instructions.txt)

1. Automatic configuring Access Point
    - Hotspot: Configure always-on hotspot using Pi's built-in Wi-Fi and Ethernet port
        - You lose the ability to connect to the internet using built in Wi-Fi
    - [Auto-Hotspot:](./AUTO_HOTSPOT.md) Automatically connect to known Wi-Fi if available, or become hotspot if no
      network is found.
        - If your Pi has been configured to connect to Wi-Fi, this option allows you to use that Wi-Fi when in range,
          and still create a hotspot when not in range
        - full
          explanation: [here](https://www.raspberryconnect.com/projects/65-raspberrypi-hotspot-accesspoints/158-raspberry-pi-auto-wifi-hotspot-switch-direct-connection)

Helpful developer/back-end stuff:

1. A wizard setup of the Install-Manager software
1. Embedded self-updating feature
1. Automatic installation of all required dependencies
1. Adding aliases to the system
1. Showing connected I2C devices
1. Showing Raspberry GPIO in the terminal
1. Embedded logging feature with an option to upload log file to the cloud

We assume in our instructions and provided setup process that you already have your Raspbian OS set up. <br/>
If not, please follow those instructions: 

[Raspbian setup instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).
<br/><br/>
This software works best with Raspbian Buster or newer (due to native python3.6+ support).

Read more about supported python and OS versions [here](/docs/python36_help.txt).
