If you want to flash custom firmware, you have to put it into a specific folder
in specific format - as described below.

'custom_node.hex' - name required by a flashing software

Remember to use files that contain bootloader. In Arduino IDE you have to:
'Tools' -> 'Board' -> 'Arduino Nano'
and
'Tools' -> 'Processor' -> 'ATmega328P (old bootloader)' -> old bootloader
or
'Tools' -> 'Processor' -> 'ATmega328P' -> new bootloader

Next:
'Sketch' -> 'Export compiled Binary' -> 'Show Sketch Folder' (after successful compiling)

Next - find a file named like 'my_file.ino.with_bootloader.eightanaloginputs.hex'.
Change its name to 'custom_node.hex'. Next place that file (using scp, winscp etc.)
in '~/RH-ota/firmware/<chosen_bootloader_version>/custom_firmware/' in the Raspbian OS on the Pi,
so the path looks like: '~/RH-ota/firmware/new_bootloader/custom_firmware/custom_node.hex'
or '~/RH-ota/firmware/old_bootloader/custom_firmware/custom_node.hex'

Next - open OTA software, enter Nodes flash and update in Main Menu and navigate
to 'Flash nodes individually' choose the node and use the option "Flash custom firmware..."

If you use new bootloader it will be flashed in second attempt.
